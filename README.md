LinGUIne
========

LinGUIne is a toolkit for language and data analyses in the Language Science and
Natural Language Processing domain. It allows its users to import and display 
linguistic data, perform a series of analyses on this data, and represent the 
results in meaningful and intuitive visualizations. It also allows for users to
annotate these data, as well as export the results and visualizations. 
Additionally it allows the users to perform quick analyses on data imported 
from commonly used social media and networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and 
blogs. LinGUIne is also flexible and extensible, allowing developers outside of
the original development team to easily create and contribute new functionality
to the toolkit.

Anyone interested in the further development LinGUIne should contact 
Professor Cecilia Ovesdotter Alm, Ph.D of the Rochester Institute of Technology
College of Liberal Arts.
